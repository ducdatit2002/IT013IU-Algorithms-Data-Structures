/*
 * Reading student records from a file, generating Student objects, counting and averaging
 * Suggested exercises:
 * - Use grade to determine the type of the student: excellent (> 89), ok [60,89], and failure (< 60)
 * - Define an enum type {excellent, ok, failure} and use it to print the student type
 * - Do counting and averaging within each student type (excellent, ok, and failure)
 * - Count students by using a static variable in class Student
